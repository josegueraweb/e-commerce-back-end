# E-Commerce Back End

## Description

This repository showcases a fully functional Back End that I built for a fictional e-commerce company akin to Amazon, Shopify, or WooCommerce.

![E-Commerce Back End App]()

## Features

Connecting to the database enables you to view, input, update, or delete items within it.

## Programming Languages and Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MySQL
- Sequelize
- Dotenv

## How to Use the Project

NOTE: Node.js, MySQL, and some sort of API management platform (i.e. Insomnia, postman) must be downloaded on to your local machine prior to using this application. 

The steps to using the app are as follows: 

1. Clone the repository onto your local machine and navigate to the app's root directory using a CLI. Run the command "npm i" to install relavent application dependecies.

1. Open the MySQL shell in your CLI and run the commands:
    - source db/schema.sql
    - use ecommerce_db

1. Exit the MySQL shell, then execute npm run seed at the app's root. 

1. Issue the command "node server.js".

1. Open Insomnia to create GET, POST, PUT, DELETE routes for interacting with the app database.
